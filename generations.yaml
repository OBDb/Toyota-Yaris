generations:
  - name: "First Generation (XP10)"
    start_year: 1998
    end_year: 2005
    description: "The first-generation Toyota Yaris (marketed as the Echo in North America and the Vitz in Japan) was introduced as Toyota's new global subcompact car, replacing the Tercel/Starlet in various markets. Featuring distinctive, somewhat polarizing styling with a tall, rounded profile maximizing interior space within minimal exterior dimensions, the original Yaris established a design philosophy prioritizing interior packaging efficiency. Available in three-door and five-door hatchback configurations plus a sedan variant (primarily for North America), the Yaris was powered by a range of small-displacement engines including 1.0, 1.3, and 1.5-liter units, paired with either manual or automatic transmissions. The interior featured an unconventional center-mounted instrument cluster and surprisingly spacious accommodations given the compact exterior, with clever storage solutions and flexible seating arrangements. Safety features were relatively advanced for the segment and era, with available ABS and multiple airbags. This generation successfully established the Yaris/Echo/Vitz as Toyota's entry-level global offering, appealing to buyers seeking efficiency, value, and Toyota's reputation for reliability in a compact package, though the North American Echo variant faced criticism for its unconventional styling and sparse standard equipment."

  - name: "Second Generation (XP90)"
    start_year: 2005
    end_year: 2013
    description: "The second-generation Toyota Yaris featured more conventional, mainstream styling compared to its somewhat quirky predecessor, with smoother lines and a more substantial appearance while maintaining compact dimensions suitable for urban environments. Available in three-door and five-door hatchback configurations in most markets, with a sedan variant in some regions (particularly North America), this generation grew slightly in all dimensions, offering improved interior space and comfort. Engine options varied by market but typically included 1.0, 1.3, and 1.5-liter gasoline units, with diesel options available in some regions, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The interior design was more conventional than the previous generation, relocating the instruments from the center to a traditional position in front of the driver in most markets, while improving material quality and feature content. Safety advanced with standard stability control in many markets and up to nine airbags available in some configurations. This generation successfully refined the Yaris formula with more mature styling and enhanced refinement while maintaining the model's focus on efficiency, reliability, and value, broadening its appeal beyond first-time buyers to include a wider range of consumers seeking a practical, economical small car."

  - name: "Third Generation (XP130)"
    start_year: 2011
    end_year: 2020
    description: "The third-generation Toyota Yaris continued the model's evolution with more dynamic styling featuring sharp character lines, a prominent trapezoidal grille, and a more aggressive overall appearance. Available primarily as a three-door and five-door hatchback (with the sedan discontinued in many markets), this generation maintained similar exterior dimensions to its predecessor while offering improved interior packaging and enhanced safety features. Engine options varied significantly by market but typically included 1.0, 1.3, and 1.5-liter gasoline units and a 1.4-liter diesel in some regions, with hybrid variants introduced for the first time in select markets, combining a 1.5-liter engine with an electric motor for improved efficiency. Transmission options included manual, conventional automatic, and continuously variable transmissions depending on market and engine. The interior saw improvements in design, material quality, and technology, with available features including touchscreen infotainment systems, keyless entry and start, and enhanced connectivity options. Safety technology advanced substantially with Toyota Safety Sense becoming available on higher trim levels in later years, offering features like pre-collision system, lane departure alert, and automatic high beams—advanced technology for the subcompact segment. This generation further established the Yaris as a key player in the global subcompact segment, offering a compelling combination of efficiency, safety, technology, and Toyota's reputation for reliability, though with increasing differentiation between variants sold in different global markets."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (XP210)"
    start_year: 2020
    end_year: null
    description: "The fourth-generation Toyota Yaris represents a comprehensive redesign, now based on Toyota's TNGA-B (Toyota New Global Architecture) platform providing improved rigidity, lower center of gravity, and enhanced driving dynamics. Available primarily as a five-door hatchback (with three-door variants largely discontinued), this generation features dynamic styling with a more aggressive front end, muscular wheel arches, and a sporty overall appearance—particularly in the performance-oriented GR Yaris variant. Notably, the North American Yaris became a rebadged Mazda2 in 2016 and was subsequently discontinued entirely in 2020, making this fourth generation primarily relevant to European, Asian, and other global markets. Engine options vary by market but center around an improved 1.5-liter three-cylinder gasoline engine available in both conventional and hybrid forms, the latter now using a lithium-ion battery for reduced weight and improved performance. For the first time, all-wheel drive is available in the GR Yaris performance variant, which features a turbocharged 1.6-liter three-cylinder producing up to 261 horsepower—a radical departure from the Yaris's economy car roots. The interior adopts a more driver-focused design with improved materials, a standard 7-inch or optional 10-inch touchscreen infotainment system, digital instrument cluster on higher trims, and enhanced connectivity options. Safety technology is comprehensive with Toyota Safety Sense standard across most trim levels, offering features including pre-collision system with pedestrian and cyclist detection, adaptive cruise control, lane trace assist, and road sign assist. This generation elevates the Yaris's position in the subcompact segment with significantly improved driving dynamics, sophisticated hybrid technology, comprehensive safety features, and the addition of a genuine performance variant, broadening its appeal beyond the efficiency and value focus of previous generations while maintaining the model's reputation for reliability and practicality."
